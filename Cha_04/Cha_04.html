        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol class = "recipeList">
        <li>Adjust the oven rack to the lower-middle position and preheat<br>            oven to 350<sup>o</sup>F(177<sup>o</sup>C).</li>
        <br>
        <li><b>Make the crust:</b> Using a food processor, pulse the graham<br>            crackers into crumbs. Pour into a medium bowl and stir in sugar<br>            and melted butter until combined. (You can also pulse it all,<br>            together in the food processor.) Mixture will be sandy. Press firmly<br>            into the bottom and slightly up the sides of a 9-inch or 10-inch<br>            springform pan. No need to grease the pan first. I use the bottom<br>            of a measuring cup to pack the crust down tightly. Pre-bake for 8<br>            minutes. Remove from the oven and place the hot pan on a large<br>            piece of aluminium foil. The foil will wrap around the pan for<br>            water bath in step 4. Allow crust to slightly cool as you prepare<br>            the filling.</li>
        <br>
        <li> <b>Make the filling:</b> Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a<br>             paddle attachment,baet the cream cheese and granulated sugar<br>             together on medium-high speed in a large bowl until the mixture<br>             is smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes. Add the sour cream,<br>             vanilla extract, and lemon juice then beat until fully combined. On<br>             medium speed, add the eggs one at a time, beating after each<br>             addition until just blended. After the final egg is incorporated into<br>             the batter, stop mixing. To help prevent cheesecake from delating <br>             and cracking as it cools, avoid over-mixing the batter as best you can.</li>
        <br>
        <li><b> Prepare the simple water bath(see note)</b> Boil a pot of water.<br>             You need 1 inch of water in your roasting pan for the water bath, <br>             so make sure you boil enough. I use an entire kettle of hot water.<br>             As the water is heating up, wrap the aluminimum foil around the<br>             springfoam pan. Pour the cheesecake batter on top of the crust.<br>             Use a rubber spatula or spoon to smooth it into an even layer.
             Place the pan inside of a large roasting pan Carefully pour the<br>             hot water inside of the pan and place the oven. (or you can place the
             roasting pan in oven first, then the hot water<br>             in. Whichever is easier for you.)</li>
        <br>
        <li>Bake cheesecake for 55 -70 minutes or until the center is almost<br>            set. When it's done, the center of the cheesecake will slightly<br>            wobble if you gently shake the pan. Turn the oven off and open<br>            the over door slightly. Let the cheesecake sit in the oven in the<br>            water bath as it cools down for 1 hour. Remove from the oven<br>            and water bath, then cool cheesecake completely at room<br>            temperature. Then refrigerate the cheesecake for at least 4 hours<br>            or overnight.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Use a knife to loosen the chilled cheesecake from the rim of the<br>             springform pan, then remove the rim. Using a clean sharp knife,<br>             cut into slices for serving. For neat slices, wipe the knife clean and<br>             dip into warm water between each slice.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Serve cheesecake with desired toppings. Cover and store leftover<br>            cheesecake in the refrigeratr for upto 5 days.</li>
